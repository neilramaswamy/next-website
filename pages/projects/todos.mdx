<h3>Context</h3>

Over the years, I've worked on a bunch of projects! I've only recently started documenting these experiences, but I hope that by the end of the year, I'll have immortalized my work over the past few years. What follows is a list of projects that I hope to write about soon.

<h3>Content</h3>

-   Mind Control: hijack an EEG reader to turn on the lights in your room just by concentrating hard!
-   Core chords: a simple tool to help you learn difficult Jazz chords.
-   Private WiFi: create a private WiFi network for yourself by proxying requests through your RasPi.
-   My website: how I built this website using Next and MDX.
-   Harker Volunteering: the volunteering portal I made with HarkerDev that my highschool still uses.
