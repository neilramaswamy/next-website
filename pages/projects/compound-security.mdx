<h3>Introduction</h3>

Please note that this is all placeholder text. Most of what follows is a joke. I'll try to make it more formal when the entire site is done.

Before I went to college (the summer of 2019), I worked with my good pal Ryan Adolf to create Compound Security. The goal for this project was to be able to open the gate to my driveway with my Google Assistant. Unfortunately, we're not as far in the future as I thought we were, so my gate didn't have any nice API. How rude of the gate maker! They did, though, have a voice assistant intgration for like $50, but I wasn't going to pay money to have my fun _taken away from me_.

<h3>The Technical Steps</h3>

So instead we set out on this fun project of securely getting my gate to open (or really, any other infrared-powered dumb device (not a smart device, because garages and gates are pretty dumb)). Here was the data flow that we came up with:

1. Google Assistant does magical wagical AI to detect a user intent to open the gate.
2. Google Assistant servers callback a server I had running on GCP
3. GCP server sends a message down a websockety socket to a RasPi sitting in my garage
4. RasPi activates one of its GPIO pins
5. GPIO pins completes the circuit on a soldered-on garage opener PCB
6. The Light Gods send a fancy dancy signal to my gate, which makes the doors open
7. On success, data flows backwards to notify the user whether their wish was granted

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

One of the most important lessons I learned from this project is to exhale when soldering. Lead doesn't feel that great when you inhale it. It's not like those Jewel Pods that the kidz these dayz are doing.

I also learned about GPIO pins for the first time. I didn't know that that was a thing. It was pretty magical to make my first leap from the software world into the hardware world.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I really could go into more technical detail about how all this worked and how some of this made me want to throw my head against a wall, but what's the fun in that. I also could put up pictures, but I don't have any since I didn't have that much foresight back then. But it did work, and my parents were impressed. What more can I ask for in life?
