<h3>Introduction</h3>

We were like, "OMG, people's munney is getting stolen!" So then we were like "OMG let's write some codez! We totally know what we're doing!"

So we did some bad designs and some good codez and then here we are, $250,000 processed. Unfortunately, John Lynch was like "aw heck nah, I hate Typescript! Instead of Typescript, we're going to use C#".

<h3>Design Fails</h3>

So apparently at some point people thought Harker Pay was free money. I swear, we put dollar signs all over the app and made it clear that people would get CHARGED, but it's still a design fail if a user thinks that a payment app is using a free-money currency. I had to make an announcement at school meeting that Harker Pay wasn't free money. You would be happy to know that we are all now studying Computer Science.

<h3>The End</h3>

John rewrote Harker Pay in C# and so our code died. But I actually did design the favicon, which is still in use. So that's pretty lit.
